## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Summary Paragraph
# We chose to incorporate this graph into our research as we believe it accurately
# depicts the long-run perspective on female labor force participation rates
# over the course of the past 100 years. We chose to include many countries
# in this visualizaiton as we believe it encompasses broader trends across
# the world. One observation from the graph is that a majority of the data
# was compiled beginning in the 1960-70s, with very few countries having data
# that dates back prior to the 1920s. Another observation is that nearly every
# country has experienced rapid growth in the percentage of the female population,
# 15+, that is economically active compared to the growth rates in the earlier
# periods, such as 1920-1960.

#Summary Paragraph
#We decided to include a chart of the unemployment rate with the most recent data (2017) to show the current (or most recent) 
#state of female unemployment. The other data sets displays trends over time so this data set summarizes that state that those 
#long-term trends have lead to. Unemployment data is a major indicator of job certainty and equality so we chose
#this feature as a key one to highlight. The observations include unemployment data from 2017 from most countries in
#the world. The countries that were not documented in the data set are displayed in white on the graph. This map is in the form
#of a heat map where the more red the countries are, the higher unemployment rate they have, and the more pink the 
#countries are, the lower unemployment rate they have.

# Summary Paragraph
# We chose to incorporate this graph into our research as we believe it does 
# a great job of showing the changes in the number of females in the labor
# force, over the course of 1990 through 2030 (projected). Through the stacked
# area chart, it very clearly shows the changes in the labor force numbers
# by age group, with the legend/color scale directly to the right of the chart.
# One immediate observation from the chart is that groups, particularly ages
# 15-24, 25-34, and 35-44 have experienced the highest growth rates over the 
# period.
