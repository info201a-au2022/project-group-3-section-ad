#### ***Abstract:***
Our main question in this project is ***how female participation in the labor force has evolved over time?*** This question is important because despite their being an increase in female participation in recent years, there is still gender inequality in the workplace and aim to uncover the reasons why through our analysis. In our analysis, we plan to compare the evolution of participation *by country, age, gender, and how it corresponds to the general wealth and development of a given country.*

#### ***Introduction:*** 
One of the primary trends that defined the 20th century was its radical increase in the number of women participating in labor markets across early-industrialized countries. Due to this fascination with women's employment, ***Estaban Ortiz-Ospina, Sandra Tzvetkova and Max Roser*** set out to uncover how and why these changes are taking place. In their research, they worked to present the key facts and drivers behind this important change in our society with leading questions such as what are the effects of married women driving the increase in female labor participation in rich countries, why men continue to participate in labor markets more frequently than women, how female labor participation varies across age, and more. 

While our group was initially drawn to directing our focus on a climate related issue, *we recognized the structural changes of the economy that have come from the increase in female labor force participation rates* and the *importance that it plays in a societies’ productivity and innovative nature*. As a result, we aim to gain a better understanding of this topic through an in depth analysis of the data set and external research efforts. 

&nbsp;

#### ***Problem Domain:*** 
The subject of our project is regarding female participation in the workforce. To get a comprehensive view of this topic, we *plan to analyze and report on how the evolution of female labor force participation benchmarks to different factors* including time, country, age, gender and economic development. To do so, we will start the report with a historical perspective of the topic. We will use our data sets to create graphs around how female labor force participation has increased over time in various countries and on the average weekly hours worked for females in different countries over time. Next, the report would transition to analyzing and displaying data regarding the current state of female labor force participation. These graphs will include the comparison of rates in different countries, the ratio of female to male rates, how the rates vary by age in different countries, and how the rates vary by country based on economic development. After analyzing the current state of the female labor force, we will analyze and report on data that will cover the factors that affect female labor supply. This will include looking at factors such as *maternal health, fertility, childcare policies, labor-saving consumer durables, social norms, and structural changes of the economy*. To supplement these factors we will incorporate research papers and reports from the following sources.

*Maternal Education, Female Labor Force Participation and Child Mortality:* https://www.jstor.org/stable/40652017

*Childcare Policies: Key for Female Labor Participation:* https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/10.1596/978-1-4648-0902-6_ch2

*Economic Development, Structural Change, and Women’s Labor Force Participation:* https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-013-0488-2 


At the end of the report, we will plan to include a summary that highlights the takeaways from our findings. In this summary, we plan to include information on the evolution of females in the labor force, its current state, and factors that affect its growth or lack of growth. Finally at the very end, we will include a sub-note that conceptually defines “work” and how work has been measured from survey data. 

* *Human Values*
  + This topic and report are aimed around the human value of gender equality. There is a clear lag of female labor force participation in comparison to men labor force participation and through this report, we hope to unveil two things. The first is a good understanding of the current state of the female labor force and the second is the reasons why the female labor force is at the state it is in. 
  
* *Direct and Indirect Stakeholders*  
  + Direct stakeholders involved with this data and report might include individuals who are passionate about gender inequality and specifically want to learn more about female labor force participation. Indirect stakeholders might be legislators who are being presented this data by advocates who are passionate about increasing female labor workforce participation. 
* *Potential Benefits and Harms*
  + Possible harms include making assumptions in our analysis about the outcomes and implications these datasets are revealing. Potential benefits include increasing the awareness around female labor force participation and encouraging action.

#### ***Research Questions:*** 
* *What are the main factors that contribute to men participating in the labor force more than women on a global scale?*
  + Historically in most countries men make up a majority of the labor force. Getting a basic understanding of how labor markets are organized around the world is an essential foundation for answering many of the other questions we have. 
* *Why has participation of women of working age in the labor force increased drastically in the last century?*
  + Analyzing why female participation in the labor force has increased substantially in both individual countries and globally in the past century is a key component to how involvement has changed over time. 
* *Why has participation of women in the labor force decreased or slowed in recent years?*
  +	A variety of factors have contributed to female participation in the labor force being stunted or decreasing entirely in recent years. Examining why this has taken place is important to how participation has evolved over time. 
* *How does the economic climate and development of a country affect female participation in the labor force?*
  +	Female participation in the labor force has shown to be highest in countries with the greatest or least wealth. Looking at why this has been the case and how this correlates to the development of a country is an important part of why there is still such prevalent gender inequality in the workforce.

#### ***The Dataset:*** 

Our dataset details rates of male to female participation in the workforce, female participation rates in the workforce both long and short term, and relates this to population and economic climate. All of these datasets help to answer our research questions specifically and ultimately answer how female participation in the workforce has evolved over time. There are also a variety of other factors involved in the dataset that help to provide context to why involvement has developed the way it has over time. Unemployment and time dedicated to unpaid care work are just two examples of other factors brought up in the data set.

In regard to the provenance of our dataset, it was collected by *Our World in Data* for the first time in 2018. Since its inception, the *Our World in Data* has kept the information up-to-date with current and updated datasets. The purpose of collecting this data was to report on the growth of female labor force participation which is known as one of the major economic developments  of the last century. The data collection effort is funded by donations given to the *Our World in Data* organization. The *Our World in Data* organization is also ***supported by the University of Oxford and Y Combinator***. The individuals that are likely to benefit from the data to make money are researchers, reporters and those that are advocates of female labor force participation. These are the people that might take this data and analyze it and create their own reports that they can then sell to news sources or present to governmental entities. The data is validated and held secure as a lot of it comes from government sources or government sponsored sources who have quality standards and regulations. Therefore, we believe this data to be trustworthy. We obtained this data through the World in Data website and we credit the source of the data because World in Data is a reputable source backed by well-known and regarded organizations.

#### ***Expected Implications:*** 
There are many possible implications that we can expect for our various stakeholders (i.e., technologists, designers, policymakers). Beginning with technologists, they can apply the data from our research to their respective industries in an effort to improve workflows and culture. Additionally, they can incorporate new technology and findings from our report to resolve problems that are currently existing in their organization relating to diversity and equality. With designers, they can utilize our findings to create visual and effective marketing materials. Through these materials, they can portray information relating to participation in the female labor force to a variety of intended audiences. Designers have the *ability to spark immense change in a very rapid manner through a clear and helpful visual*. Lastly, policymakers can use our research findings to pass legislation relating to cutting the gap between male and female participation in the workforce. Through our research, they can make inferences about larger populations to recognize which industries or states need the most reform, and can act accordingly. 

&nbsp;

#### ***Limitations:***
Some limitations that we might need to address in this project include the ***differences in time span across the various data files***. For example, OurWorldInData compiled data surrounding What Percentage of the US Public Approves of Working Wives? From 1936 to 1998 while the International Labor Organization (United Nations) compile data surrounding The Change in Children per Woman and Female Labor Force Participation compiled data from 1960 to 2021. We can try to limit this by associating data sets with similar time periods and placing an emphasis on recent data as opposed to more aged.

Aside from time span inconsistencies, another limitation we might need to address is the reality that ***many countries have very poor capacity to produce national statistics***. More specifically, labor force participation is currently being measured from population censuses, rather than the labor force surveys being especially designed for that purpose. Data sources often have different methods of measuring these statistics and it is important to make an emphasis on limiting the discrepancies between the various data-tracking methods.
